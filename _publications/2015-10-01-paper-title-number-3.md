description: "Resorted to Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient method to analyze the correlation between the biggest 29 wind power plants in Europe. Extracted spatiotemporal features using TCN and CBAM-based CBTCN to effectively capture temporal series information and weighted feature maps, improving the model's expression ability and discrimination. Utilized the sparse self-attention mechanism, Transformer, and fully connected neural network to extract high-dimensional nonlinear features and generate prediction results. Incorporated spatiotemporal features processed by CBTCN into the Transformer model to achieve feature interaction and integration via the self-attention mechanism."

In our study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of short-term offshore wind power prediction using a novel approach that integrates TCN-Transformer architecture with CBAM attention mechanism (CBTCN). The process involved exploring the correlation among the largest 29 wind power plants in Europe using Pearson's correlation coefficient. We then harnessed TCN and CBAM-based CBTCN to extract spatiotemporal features, enhancing the model's capability to capture temporal patterns and weighted features effectively, thus improving expression and discrimination.

To enhance predictive accuracy, we implemented a multi-step mechanism. We introduced a sparse self-attention mechanism, integrated within the Transformer architecture, for extracting high-dimensional nonlinear features. The spatiotemporal features, processed by CBTCN, were integrated into the Transformer model to enable feature interaction and integration through the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, a fully connected neural network was employed to extract intricate nonlinear features from the Transformer's outputs, leading to refined prediction results.

Our approach not only leverages sophisticated techniques like CBAM and Transformer but also harnesses the power of TCN and self-attention mechanisms for capturing spatiotemporal dependencies and nonlinear patterns. Through this comprehensive integration, our model demonstrates enhanced predictive capabilities for complex offshore wind power systems, holding significant potential for accurate and reliable short-term predictions.
