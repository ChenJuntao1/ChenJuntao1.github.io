In this study, we propose an innovative approach for predicting Chongqing's GDP. We combine the LASSO method with the CWOA-BP-ARIMA model to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Through meticulous feature selection based on Pearson correlation and Lasso regression, we identify key economic indicators that are closely linked to Chongqing's GDP.
