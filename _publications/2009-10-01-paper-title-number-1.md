excerpt: 'In this paper ,we propose an innovative approach for Chongqing's GDP prediction, combining the LASSO method with the CWOA-BP-ARIMA model. Through meticulous feature selection based on Pearson correlation and Lasso regression, we identify key economic indicators linked to Chongqing's GDP. '
