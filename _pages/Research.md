## The Prediction of Chongqing's GDP Using a Hybrid Approach

**Authors:** Jun Chen, Jie Wu  

### Abstract

In this research, we present a novel approach for predicting Chongqing's GDP by integrating the LASSO method with the Chaotic Whale Group Algorithm (CWOA), Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and ARIMA model. Our method involves careful feature selection using both Pearson correlation analysis and Lasso regression techniques, enabling us to identify the most influential economic indicators linked to Chongqing's GDP.
