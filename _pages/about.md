Welcome!

My name is Juntao Chen, a senior undergraduate student in Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences-University of North Carolina Wilmington (CQWU-UNCW Joint bachelorâ€™s degree Program) [School of Mathematics and Big Data](https://mathinternational.cqwu.edu.cn/).I am studying for my fourth year. I have a strong motivation to apply for a doctoral degree in statistics.

I am pursuing a major in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Over the past three years, I have diligently cultivated a robust understanding of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jibo-Wu-2).

You can find my CV here:[Juntao Chen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV-Juntao Chen.pdf).
