## 1. The Prediction of Chongqing's GDP

**Authors:** Jun Chen, Jie Wu

**Venue:** Scientific Reports  

### Abstract

In this study, we propose an innovative approach for predicting Chongqing's GDP. We combine the LASSO method with the Chaotic Whale Group Algorithm (CWOA), Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and ARIMA model. Through meticulous feature selection based on Pearson correlation and Lasso regression, we identify key economic indicators linked to Chongqing's GDP.
